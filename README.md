# TicTacToe

Seriously... Tic-Tac-Toe? Absolutely! Challenge your friends to a game of this childhood classic!

The practicality of developing this game was to practice utilizing both Factory Functions and The Module Pattern.

Note: The module pattern wraps a factory in an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression).
